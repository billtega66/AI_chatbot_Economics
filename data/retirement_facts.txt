Many American workers today face significant financial hurdles when saving for retirement due to economic challenges, inflation, and lingering financial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Employed workers in the U.S. have an estimated median household retirement savings of around $82,000, but many remain concerned that they won't save enough by retirement age.

Although 83% of employed workers actively save for retirement through workplace plans or personal accounts, about 37% have taken loans or made early withdrawals, potentially jeopardizing their retirement readiness.

Approximately 36% of employed workers expect to retire at age 70 or later, or they don't plan to retire at all, and more than half anticipate continuing to work part-time after retirement age.

Self-employed workers typically have median retirement savings of about $87,000, but only around 60% regularly contribute to retirement accounts, and they typically start saving later in life (median age of 29).

Over half (55%) of self-employed individuals intend to retire after age 70 or not retire at all, and notably, just 22% have a formally documented retirement plan, emphasizing the need for proactive financial planning among this group.

Unemployed workers are particularly vulnerable, with median retirement savings of only about $700; only 26% currently save for retirement, and approximately one-third have no retirement savings at all.

Unemployed workers largely depend on future Social Security payments or continued employment for retirement income, highlighting their increased financial risk and the critical need for employment-based retirement plans.

Workers generally prioritize quality of life (59%), physical health (56%), and financial planning (46%) as key life goals, yet many underestimate their longevity, planning for a median lifespan of 88 years—potentially leaving them underprepared financially for retirement.

Key fears among workers include declining health and the need for expensive long-term care, outliving their retirement savings, and uncertainty regarding the stability of Social Security benefits.

About 72% of U.S. workers are concerned that Social Security benefits might not be available or adequate when they retire, reinforcing the necessity of supplemental personal retirement savings.

While about 69% of workers believe they have adequate knowledge of personal finance, roughly one-third (34%) have borrowed or prematurely withdrawn funds from their retirement accounts, negatively impacting their future financial stability.

Emergency savings remain inadequate for most workers, with a median emergency fund of approximately $5,000, making them vulnerable to financial shocks that could further deplete their retirement savings.

Recommended retirement preparation includes creating detailed, written financial strategies, avoiding loans and early withdrawals from retirement accounts, regularly reviewing and adjusting retirement investment portfolios, and prioritizing both mental and physical health.

Employers play a crucial role by sponsoring retirement plans, offering financial wellness education, and promoting flexible work arrangements that support employees’ financial security and well-being.

Policymakers are urged to strengthen retirement security by addressing the sustainability of Social Security and Medicare, enhancing access to affordable healthcare and housing, encouraging lifelong learning, and improving financial literacy across all age groups.
By age 35, it is recommended to have retirement savings equal to one to one-and-a-half times your annual salary. For example, an individual earning $60,000 annually should have between $60,000 and $90,000 saved.

At age 50, the suggested retirement savings benchmark increases to three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half times your annual salary. Therefore, someone earning $60,000 per year should aim for $210,000 to $330,000 in retirement savings by this age.

By age 60, retirement savings should ideally reach six to eleven times your annual salary. A person making $60,000 annually should target having between $360,000 and $660,000 saved.

To meet these retirement savings benchmarks, financial experts from T. Rowe Price recommend consistently saving approximately 15% of your annual income, including contributions from your employer.

These retirement savings guidelines provide a helpful measure of your preparedness, but individual circumstances and lifestyle choices can significantly impact the actual amount needed.

If your current retirement savings fall below these recommended targets, it is crucial to consider increasing your savings rate, potentially through automatic contributions, budget adjustments, or professional financial advice.

Regularly checking your savings progress and adjusting your strategy accordingly can greatly improve your likelihood of achieving a secure and comfortable retirement.
